 #1 A password generator is needed for this project
 
Using javascript we will have a secured randomly generated password for our clients.
 We want to generate a secure password for the user at any length
 
 
What is a password generator?
A Password generator is usually a software tool that creates random or customized passwords for the user.
 
How will it work?
The user will load up the landing page, then there will be a button to click that will allow you to generate a new random password.
 
The button will have an on click function that will be made in javascript to run a line of code that will generate a random password then it will be printed to the landing page (using the letters, numbers and special characters from aA-zZ, 0-9,!-+) for the user to see and note down for their own personal use.
